  <h4>Hackday Project for Cardinal Blue</h4>
  We wanted to create an app that takes advantage of the popular Sanrio character, Gudetama, but actually make it useful for people. We decided to use the character to motivate people into having a healthier lifestyle.

  <h4>User Interview Key Findings</h4>
  Users like to keep track of specific activities but generally do not record diets<br /><br />
  The average user (doesn't have special health needs) do not like to input data for activities that don't give them a sense of accomplishment (e.g. eating)<br /><br />
  Users prefer apps that can automatically record physical activity without user input, especially typing in information<br /><br />
  Girls that like Gudetama like to collect Gudetama themed products<br /><br />

  <h4>Challenges</h4>
  One of the hardest challenges was coming up with a system that could easily translate a user's activity into quantifiable rewards. For example, recording meal content would be too difficult to objectively quantify into a reward system and we didn't want to depend on users painstakingly inputing lots of data. A user's actions need to be automatically recorded and turned into rewards with a quantitative scale.

  <h4>How to influence user behavior?</h4>
  Another challenge was influencing a user's behavior. We thought of translating user activity into food for Gudetama, but this is not enough as there is no novelty factor for the user. There needed to be something always new to get them hooked into using the app again. Being able to see the same Gudetama animations would not be exciting enough; we needed to add something that transformed him so you get something new when you use the app. We looked at apps like Pokemon Go and Taipei Walker, which both motivate users by providing new things to collect.

  <h4>Goals</h4>
  Track specific user activity<br />
  Translate user activity into quantifiable rewards<br />
  Influence user's behavior by creating incentives they want to collect<br />
  Minimize data input for user<br />

  <h4>Solution</h4>
  We decided to narrow it down to one activity: walking. This greatly simplified the reward system we needed to create, allows the user to more easily accomplish the goals in their daily life, and eliminates the need to input data regularly. To solve both the incentive and activity quantification problem, I suggested a coin system that can be used to buy collectible rewards for your pet. A set number of steps will earn you coins, which can be used to buy goodies that Gudetama can interact with. Goodies will range from basic to luxurious, so this should motivate users to keep using the app so they can collect increasingly luxurious goodies to see more funny interactions.

  <h4>User Persona: Emily</h4>
  "I like cute characters and would enjoy being able to interact with them personally."

  <h4>Learnings</h4>
  This was the most challenging hackday project I designed for, so I learned a lot through those challenges. I gained new understanding of what specific motivations and desires could change behavior. I also learned how to extract information from user interviews and precisely organize that data to create a useful system. Further work on this app would require a better management system for users to own and use these goodies. Of course, this app would need to be further tested among users.

  <h4>Process</h4>
  <div class="textcontainer containerprocess">
  interviews, define, ideate, wireframes, visual design<br /><br />
  My team pitched, conducted interviews, designed, developed, and presented the app within two days. My team included a developer, two designers, and two product managers. We worked collaboratively to come up with the user requirements and user flow. I came up with the coin and reward purchase idea and was in charge of the wireframe and designing the user interface. I worked closely with a developer to create the visual UI assets. Screens were prototyped using Photoshop and Sketch.
