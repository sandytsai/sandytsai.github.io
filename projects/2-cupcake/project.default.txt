<h4>chronicle books design fellowship</h4>
The creative director asked us to design and pitch concept ideas for a product that could be a "clever container." I presented the editors with a physical prototype of an Origami Square Cupcake Liner Kit. The kit contains 12 cupcake liners and instructions for making square origami cupcake liners.<br /><br />

I researched materials extensively, both for the container itself and what could be contained. I wanted to create a product that allows users to interact with it intimately, not just put things in it. <br /><br />

I designed the liners, packaging, and origami instructions.<br /><br />
