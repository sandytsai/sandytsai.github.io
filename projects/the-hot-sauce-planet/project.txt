Text: This is a playful chapbook cover I illustrated and designed for one of 826 Valencia's publications. I used bright colors to somewhat contrast what you would expect of a "Hot Sauce Planet," (one of the titles of the stories) to match the fantastical imagination of elementary school kids' writing.
