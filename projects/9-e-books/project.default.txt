I created various ebooks from print titles, converting original print design files into EPUB (iPad, Nook, Kobo) and MOBI (Kindle) files. It was a challenge translating beautiful designs that were meant for print into a digital re-flowable format, but facing these challenges forced me to think of new solutions for converting print design files into ebooks. It taught me how digital reflow works differently, and I had to make decisions about changing the original design, order, and even content to fit the context of a digital device. <br /><br />

I had the great opportunity to work on many Art of Disney books such as Art of Tangled, Art of Inside Out, Art of Pixar, etc. Below are my favorite ebooks I made, including design, lifestyle, and cookbooks.
