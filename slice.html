      <div class="projectintro">
           Have you ever dined at a restaurant and felt frustrated because of the waiting and figuring out the bill? At UW, I worked on a side project to understand and improve dining experiences. Based on our research, we created a Slice, a mobile app that improves the billing process by eliminating the need to request for bills and makes bill splitting easy.

      <h4>Design Question</h4>
      <p class="p_container">How might we improve dining experiences at sit-down restaurants?
          </p>    
                  <hr class="sectionbreak2">

          
          <h4>Research Findings</h4>
          <p class="p_container">We conducted 5 semi-structured interviews with diners and waiters combined and created a survey that got about 30 respondents. We aimed to understand the pleasures and pain points of the dining experience starting from your first interaction to paying your bill. </p>
          <img src="projects/17-slice/slice-1.png" class="firstimg" alt="research" />
          
          <h4>What interactions do people prefer not to have a waiter for?</h4>

          <hr class="sectionbreak2">
          <h4>Managing Scope</h4>
          <p class="p_container">Based on our findings, waiter interaction should be increased during ordering and decreased during billing. While we found problems throughout the dining process as shown in the task flow, we felt that we needed to focus on billing as most frustrations arise there.</p>
          
          <h4>Competitive Analysis</h4>
          <p class="p_container">We conducted a competitive analysis to give us a better idea of how this problem is currently being addressed and what was successful and unsuccessful about existing solutions. We looked at direct and indirect competitors and found an opportunity with our project. </p>
          
          <h4>Our User Flow</h4>
          <p class="p_container">We created a user flow of what we thought an experience with our solution would look like and help us design.</p>

        <h4>Paper Prototyping</h4>
        <p class="p_container">We decided to create paper prototypes because it was the quickest way to test our idea on a tight timeline. </p>

          <h4>Complexity of Billing</h4>
              <p class="p_container">Bill splitting is complex and frustrating to most people, so we wanted our app to be able to anticipate many scenarios that would complicate our app, and figure out how to successfully design interactions that make something complicated straightforward and intuitive.</p>

        <div class="three_boxes">
              <h4>Self-Scheduling</h4>
          <p class="font_small">...lets workers create their own schedules. Shift workers want independence and flexibility most of all. Being able to choose preferences for when they work would address that need.</p>

              <h4>Chatbot</h4>
              <p class="font_small">...automates scheduling needs with a chatbot that handles all logistics between workers. This bot is also a neutral actor that can anonymize shift swaps and enforce regulations, increasing trust and comfort.</p>

        <h4>Solution</h4>
        <p class="p_container">I built out the system more and my teammate combined the app and chatbot into a unified experience. We also refined the wording and design, and added more quick replies to the bot to guide the user.</p>

      Luna gets a message from Hermes and sees that she can get 20 points for picking up an extra shift. She wants to reach Level 2 to get more rewards, so she accepts.

          <h4>What I learned</h4>
        <p class="p_container">I learned how to scope down ideas into a solution that targets our persona and considers the competitive landscape. This project also sharpened my project management skills. Although we had a project manager, not having a clear management hierarchy calls for organization and initiative from all team members. I also learned about the potential and advantages of using a chatbot.</p>
          
          <h4>Further Development</h4>
        <p class="p_container">Because of time constraints, we did not create a self-scheduling scenario and we focused more on the shift worker rather than the manager. We need to build out the manager’s side and create scenarios for enforcing regulations and creating schedules.</p>
