<h4>personal project</h4>
This is a handmade wedding guestbook I made for my sister Jasmine and her husband Adam. I wanted to create something very personal, customized, and handmade.<br /><br />

The cover type treatment is hand lettered, and the same type is hand sewn on vellum paper for the inside cover. The book is bound by a coptic stitch, which I learned through online tutorials.
