Title: 826 Holiday Appeal

<h4>826 Valencia internship </h4>
I designed the annual holiday appeal while I was an intern at 826 Valencia. Leading with the Design Director's concept of "Coming Soon to the Tenderloin" marquee, I researched classic theatre marquees in the art deco style. I created this print mailer with a modernized art deco illustration that matches the playfulness of 826 Valencia's visual style. The full mailer includes the flyer, the donation envelope, and in a select few a card with a personalized note.
