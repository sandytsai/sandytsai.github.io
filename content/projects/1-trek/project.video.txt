<h4>Personal Project</h4>
This is an ongoing personal project I am developing based on the start of an idea from a design-thinking workshop, where my workshop partner told me about his desire for more independent, laid-back traveling without joining a tour group.

<h4>Frustrations of Traveling</h4>
Relying on a tour group leads to less flexibility and independence <br />
Fear of being lonely when you travel by yourself<br />
Desire to travel independently without having to make detailed plans<br />

<h4>Solution</h4>
With Trek, users can join local treks from where they are living or traveling. These treks are created by users who want to explore a place but also meet new people. It is targeted towards solo trekkers, but can be used by any small group looking to connect with more people.
