<h4>Chronicle Books Design Fellowship</h4>
I designed boarding pass invitations for a collaborative project and event with the other design fellows. The five different designs represent the five fellows. We collaboratively came up with a consistent visual identity and designed different materials for the event. <br /><br />

The other fellows also created teaser posters, postcards, signage, menus, and an island logo and flag for the event. You can read more about the event here on the Chronicle Books Blog.
